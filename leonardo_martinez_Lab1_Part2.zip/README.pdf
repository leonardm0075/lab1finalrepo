Part 2_1:

    References:
    Strings are immutable so I switch them back into lists to remove all casing and non-alphanumericals and the conversion code I used in 
    line 15 is referenced from www.askpython.com/python/list/list-to-string. 
    Actually removing all non-alphanumerics I directly referenced www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-remove-all-characters-except-letters-and-numbers/ for line
    16. 

    Facts:
    My code is well commented for lines and blocks. Part2_1 is pretty straightfoward so there is nothing really to know in advance to help better assess the code.
    The code is in a while loop that restarts after complete execution, so it takes user input at the beginning and all you have to do is write the file name 
    for the file you want to read in.

Part 2_2:

    References:
    Same reference I used for part2_1 above. Otherwise the rest of my code is original.  
    
    Facts:
    Same as part2_1.
